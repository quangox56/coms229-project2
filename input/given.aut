# Comments, to be ignored
#
This bogus keyword should cause everything to be ignored
until the next semicolon, allowing for future expansion ;

Another { more evil bogus keyword; we must also consume;
the inner bogus statements; };

# Ugly formatting, but allowed:
Xrange
-10 10; Yrange -5 5;
Initial {
Y = 2 : -1; # Sets (-1, 2) to "alive"
Y=1: -2, -1; # Sets (-2, 1) and (-1, 1) to "alive"
Y=-1: 2,3,4;# Sets (2, -1), (3, -1), (4,-1) to "alive"
};
